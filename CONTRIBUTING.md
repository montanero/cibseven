# Ways to contribute

We would love you to contribute to this project. You can do so in various ways.


## Contribute your knowledge

Help others by participating in our [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cibseven/discussions).


## File bugs or feature requests

Found a bug in the code or have a feature that you would like to see in the future? [Search our open issues](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/issues) if we have it on the radar already or [create a new issue otherwise](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/issues/new/choose).

Try to apply our best practices for creating issues:

* Only Raise an issue if your request requires a code change in CIB seven
  * If you want to contact the CIB seven customer support, please go to [Contact](https://cibseven.org/en/contact/).
  * If you have an understanding question or need help building your solution, check out our [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cibseven/discussions).
* Create a high-quality issue:
  * Give enough context so that a person who doesn't know your project can understand your request
  * Be concise, only add what's needed to understand the core of the request
  * If you raise a bug report, describe the steps to reproduce the problem
  * Specify your environment (e.g. CIB seven version, CIB seven modules you use, ...)
  * Provide code. For a bug report, create a test that reproduces the problem. For feature requests, create mockup code that shows how the feature might look like. Fork our [unit test Github template](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven-engine-unittest) to get started quickly.


## Write code

You can contribute code that fixes bugs and/or implements features. Here is how it works:

1. Select a ticket that you would like to implement. Have a look at [our backlog](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/issues) if you need inspiration. Be aware that some of the issues need good knowledge of the surrounding code.
1. Tell us in the ticket comments or in the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cibseven/discussions) that you want to work on your ticket. This is also the place where you can ask questions.
1. Check your code changes against our [contribution checklist](#contribution-checklist)
1. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/pulls). Note that you can already do this before you have finished your implementation if you would like feedback on your work in progress.


# Browse our issues

In this repository, we manage the [issues](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/issues) for the CIB seven.

We use [labels](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/labels) to mark and group our issues for easier browsing. We define the following label prefixes:

* `bot:` labels that control a github app, workflow, ...
* `ci:` labels that control the CI for a pull request
* `group:` Arbitrary labels that we can define to group tickets. If you create this, please add a DRI to the description to make sure someone has ownership, e.g. to decide if we still need the label
* `potential:` Issues that we are potentially releasing with the given version. This is not a guarantee and does not express high confidence.
* `scope:` The technical scope in which the ticket makes changes.
* `type:` Issue type. Every issue should have exactly one of these labels. They are automatically added when you create a new issue from a template.
* `version:` Issues that will be released (with high confidence) with the given version.


# Build from source

In order to build our codebase from source, add the following to your Maven `settings.xml`.

```xml
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>cibseven-public</id>
    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>mvn-cibseven-public</id>
        <name>mvn-cibseven-public</name>
        <releases>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
          <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
        <url>https://artifacts.cibseven.org/public/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>
  </profile>
</profiles>
<activeProfiles>
  <activeProfile>cibseven-public</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>
```

An entire repository can then be built by running `mvn clean install` in the root directory.
This will build all sub modules and execute unit tests.
Furthermore, you can restrict the build to just the module you are changing by running the same command in the corresponding directory.
Check the repository's or module's README for additional module-specific instructions.
The `webapps` module requires NodeJS.
You can exclude building them by running `mvn clean install -pl '!webapps,!webapps/assembly,!webapps/assembly-jakarta'`.

Integration tests (e.g. tests that run in an actual application server) are usually not part of the default Maven profiles. If you think they are relevant to your contribution, please ask us in the ticket, on the forum or in your pull request for how to run them. Smaller contributions usually do not need this.

# Create a pull request

In order to show us your code, you can create a pull request on Github. Do this when your contribution is ready for review, or if you have started with your implementation and want some feedback before you continue. It is always easier to help if we can see your work in progress.

A pull request can be submitted as follows: 

1. [Fork the CIB seven repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) you are contributing to
1. Commit and push your changes to a branch in your fork
1. [Submit a Pull Request to the CIB seven repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). As the *base* branch (the one that you contribute to), select `main`. This should also be the default in the Github UI.
1. In the pull request description, reference the github issue that your pull request addresses.

# Working with upstream branches

If you have forked the CIB seven repository, you may want to fetch branches from the upstream (original) repository to stay in sync or to work with features being developed upstream. Here's how to do this:

## Set up the upstream remote

First, add the upstream repository as a remote (you only need to do this once):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven.git
```

Verify that the upstream remote was added successfully:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the original repository) listed.

## Fetch branches from upstream

To fetch all branches from the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

This downloads all branches and their commits from the upstream repository, but doesn't merge them into your local branches.

## List available upstream branches

To see all branches available from upstream:

```bash
git branch -r | grep upstream
```

## Work with an upstream branch

To check out an upstream branch and create a local tracking branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name> upstream/<branch-name>
```

For example, to work with the upstream `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b main upstream/main
```

## Keep your fork up to date

To update your fork's main branch with the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes into your main branch
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

# Contribution checklist

Before submitting your pull request for code review, please go through the following checklist:

1. Is your code formatted according to our code style guidelines?
    * Java Code Style Guidelines: You can import [template and settings files](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/tree/main/settings) into your IDE before you start coding.
    * Javascript: Your code is automatically formatted whenever you commit.
1. Is your code covered by unit tests?
    * Ask us if you are not sure where to write the tests or what kind of tests you should write.
    * Have a look at other tests in the same module for how it works.
    * In rare cases, it is not feasible to write an automated test. Please ask us if you think that is the case for your contribution.
1. Do your commits follow our [commit message conventions](#commit-message-conventions)?

# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can merge your contribution you have to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/cibseven/) (CLA). The CLA contains the terms and conditions under which the contribution is submitted. You need to do this only once for your first pull request. Keep in mind that without a signed CLA we cannot merge your contribution.

# Commit message conventions

The messages of all commits must conform to the style:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Example:

```
feat(engine): Support BPEL

- implements execution for a really old standard
- BPEL models are mapped to internal ActivityBehavior classes

related to #123
```

Have a look at the [commit history](https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/commits/main) for real-life examples.


## \<type\>

One of the following:

* feat (feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
* refactor
* test (when adding missing tests)
* chore (maintain)
 
## \<scope\>

The scope is the module that is changed by the commit. E.g. `engine` in the case of https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven/tree/main/engine.

## \<subject\>

A brief summary of the change. Use imperative form (e.g. *implement* instead of *implemented*).  The entire subject line shall not exceed 70 characters.

## \<body\>

A list of bullet points giving a high-level overview of the contribution, e.g. which strategy was used for implementing the feature. Use present tense here (e.g. *implements* instead of *implemented*). A line in the body shall not exceed 80 characters. For small changes, the body can be omitted. 

## \<footer\>

Must be `related to <ticket>` where ticket is the ticket number, e.g. 1234. If the change is related to multiple 
tickets, list them in a comma-separated list such as `related to 1234, 4321`.

Optionally, you can reference the number of the GitHub PR from which the commit is merged. The message footer can then 
look like `related to <ticket>, closes #<pr_number>` such as `related to 1234, closes #567`.


# Review process

We usually check for new community-submitted pull requests once a week. We will then assign a reviewer from our development team and that person will provide feedback as soon as possible. 

Note that due to other responsibilities (our own implementation tasks, releases), feedback can sometimes be a bit delayed. Especially for larger contributions, it can take a bit until we have the time to assess your code properly.

During review we will provide you with feedback and help to get your contribution merge-ready. However, before requesting a review, please go through our [contribution checklist](#contribution-checklist).
